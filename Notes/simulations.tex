\subsection{Description}
  This simulation tests the effect of adding additive and multiplicative random effects (latent factors) while fitting models with and without unobserved covariates.
\subsection{Pseudo-code}
  \begin{verbatim}
    Set intercept = -1
    Set beta = [1, 1, 1]
    Set gamma = 1
    Set n = 20 (network size)
    For each run:
      Set seed
      Generate X1
        Independently assign each node one of two groups, with equal
              probability.
        For each dyad (i,j), 
          X1 = 1 if i and j are in the same group
          X1 = -1 if i and j are in different groups
      Generate X2
        Indpendently assign each node a "position" from a standard normal
              distribution.
        For each dyad (i,j), X2 = the "distance" between i and j
      Generate X3
        For each dyad, X3 = independent standard normal draw
      Generate Z
        Same as X1, but independently generated
      For each rep:
        Set seed
        Generate noise (epsilon): standard normal draw for each dyad
        Set Y1 = X1*beta[1] + X2*beta[2] + X3*beta[3] + epsilon
        Set Y2 = X1*beta[1] + X2*beta[2] + X3*beta[3] + gamma*Z + epsilon
        Fit the following models and record results:
          Y1 ~ X1 + X2 + X3
          Y1 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + additive latent effects
          Y1 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + additive + multiplicative latent effects
          Y2 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + Z
          Y2 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + Z + additive latent effects
          Y2 ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + Z + additive + multiplicative latent effects

\section{Independent Covariate - Additive}
\subsection{Description}
  This simulation is designed to be an extension of the first, except for independent covariates that would be ``best" fit by additive random effects.
